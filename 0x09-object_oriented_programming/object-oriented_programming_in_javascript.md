# Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

## key principles of OOP

### 1.2. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, typically a class. This allows for data to be hidden from outside access, and only accessible through the methods provided by the class.

### 1.3. Inheritance

Inheritance is the concept of creating a new class that is based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods. This allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.

### 1.4. Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the concept of being able to use a single interface to represent different types of objects. This allows for more flexible and reusable code.

### 1.5. Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. This allows for easier understanding and manipulation of the system.
